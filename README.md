# consent-string-test

Simple console tool to decode GDPR consent string. Uses https://github.com/InteractiveAdvertisingBureau/Consent-String-SDK-JS to do the actual decoding. You can also use the one provided by appnexus http://acdn.adnxs.com/cmp/docs/#/ but considering how hectic all gdpr-related things are, it doesn't hurt to double-check using IAB's implementation.

### How to use it

`node index.js BOOON_DOOON_dABABBENAaA`
